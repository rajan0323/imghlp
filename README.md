Usage
Uploading Images
The MediaUploader component handles image uploads. Users can upload images, which are then processed by Cloudinary. Successful uploads trigger a toast notification indicating success and credit deduction.

Error Handling
The app includes error handling for common issues, such as missing subscriptions or invalid requests. Errors are communicated to users through toast notifications.

Example of Error Handling:
javascript
Copy code
const onUploadErrorHandler = () => {
  toast({
    title: 'Something went wrong while uploading',
    description: 'Please try again',
    duration: 5000,
    className: 'error-toast' 
  });
};
